# Print documents

EPITA students are able to print documents with a dedicated web interface.

## Villejuif

In Villejuif, there are two printers available for students. You can access those printers from any web browser on devices connected to the school networks. In order to connect to the printers, use one of those two IP adresses:
- [10.3.8.1](10.3.8.1)
- [10.3.8.2](10.3.8.2)

The first page provides informations related to the printer you want to print from, such as:
- State
- Ink percentage
- Sheets quantity

You need to go in the *print* section to submit your documents.

```
Be aware that only *.ps*, *.pdf*, *.prn* or *.rfu* files are accepted. 
```
